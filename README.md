# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze used car data and build a predictive model to estimate car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. The model leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate price estimates, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains details about used cars, including:
- `Brand`: Manufacturer of the car
- `Model`: Specific model name
- `Year`: Year of manufacturing
- `Mileage`: Distance traveled
- `Fuel Type`: Petrol/Diesel/Electric
- `Transmission`: Manual/Automatic
- `Price`: Actual selling price (Target Variable)

## 🔥 Features & Functionality
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends in car prices.
- **Model Training**: Uses Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation**: Compares model performance using metrics like RMSE and R² score.
- **Deployment Ready**: Can be integrated into a web app using Flask or Streamlit.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedOsman210/used-car-prediction.git
cd used-car-prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
env\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 🎯 Usage
1. **Load & Preprocess Data**: Run the notebook to clean and prepare the dataset.
2. **Train the Model**: Choose a machine learning model and train it.
3. **Evaluate Performance**: Check accuracy, RMSE, and other metrics.
4. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict car prices.

## 📈 Results
- Feature importance analysis showed that **mileage, brand, and year** are key factors in price prediction.
- The **Random Forest model** provided the highest accuracy (~90%).
